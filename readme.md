# Podcast Time Machine

Podcast time machine allows you to subscribe to a podcast but delay all entries
by a number of days.

## Why?

One of my favourite podcasts (Harmontown) ends. I only started to listen to it
a few years ago. Now I want to re-experience it from the beginning.

## Usage

You can use the builtin webserver or use the `wsgi` interface with nginx.
